## Canny Engineer Blog
My blog repository built with Gatsby.js using mhadialy's template

### Description
Hello there, I'm JD, a canny engineer. Passionate about DevOps and everything around it. I have over 9 years of experience, finished a master degree in information systems and always looking to learn something new.
<br />
In 2018, I decided to start my own personal blog to fill some gaps that I've seen while working. There are always ton of tutorials for many things, and still, I find it difficult to accomplish some tasks.
<br />
If you like what Iâ€™m accomplishing, feel free to buy me a coffee.
